In 2014, I discovered a platform called Facebook that was gaining traction in Nepal. Intrigued by its ability to bring people together on a single platform, I began exploring what made it so effective. This sparked my fascination with how technology shapes human connections and inspired me to learn more about software design and development. I dove into the world of coding, systems architecture, and user experience, driven by a desire to build solutions that solve real-world problems.

Over the years, this curiosity transformed into a career. Today, I work as a software designer and developer, collaborating with startups and international companies to create high-quality software. My focus is on delivering products that meet functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring they are not only effective but also efficient, secure, and scalable. I thrive on making systems more proficient, intuitive, and delightful to use, believing that the best software seamlessly blends functionality with simplicity.

Beyond the technical aspects, I value collaboration and empathy in my work. Understanding user needs and aligning technology with business goals are at the core of my approach. Each project is an opportunity to learn and innovate, which keeps me motivated and engaged.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in code or design challenges, I enjoy reconnecting with nature and my roots. Hiking allows me to explore new perspectives, while farm work grounds me in simplicity and hard work. I also love reading to expand my knowledge and playing football to stay active and foster teamwork. These activities balance my life, keeping me refreshed and ready to tackle new challenges in my professional journey.
