In 2014, I discovered a platform gaining traction in Nepal that connected people seamlessly. Fascinated by its impact, I delved into coding, systems design, and user experience to understand how technology drives human connections.

This curiosity grew into a career as a software designer and developer, where I now work with [startups](https://gaaubesi.com/) and [international companies](https://readytowork.jp/) to create high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly solutions. Iâ€™m passionate about blending functionality with simplicity, ensuring every system is efficient, secure, and intuitive.

Beyond the technical aspects, I value collaboration and empathy in my work. Understanding user needs and aligning technology with business goals are at the core of my approach. Each project is an opportunity to learn and innovate, which keeps me motivated and engaged.

Outside of work, I recharge through hiking, farm work, reading, and football, balancing creativity with exploration and teamwork.
