Back in 2024, i got to know abt a Facebook, which was gettting popular in Nepal. I was wandering why it was able to connect so many people in one platform. I was curious and go down the rabbithole. Now, I am design and develop softwares for  a start-ups and international comapanies.

My main focus today is to  provide quality softwares with fucntional and non-functional requirementa. I enjoy making system most profiecient and easy to use.

When i am not at computer screan, i usually go hiking , reading, doing some farm work or  play football.
